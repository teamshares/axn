# Profiling

Axn supports performance profiling using [Vernier](https://github.com/Shopify/vernier), a Ruby sampling profiler that provides detailed insights into your action's performance characteristics.

## Overview

Profiling helps you identify performance bottlenecks in your actions by capturing detailed execution traces. Vernier is particularly useful for:

- Identifying slow methods and code paths
- Understanding memory allocation patterns
- Analyzing call stacks and execution flow
- Optimizing performance-critical actions

## Setup

### 1. Install Vernier

Add the Vernier gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'vernier', '~> 0.1'
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

**Note:** Vernier is not included as a dependency of Axn, so you must explicitly add it to your Gemfile if you want to use profiling features.

### 2. Enable Profiling

No global configuration is needed! Simply call `profile` on the actions you want to profile.

## Basic Usage

Profiling is enabled per-action by calling the `profile` method. You can only call `profile` **once per action** - subsequent calls will override the previous one. This prevents accidental profiling of all actions and ensures you only profile what you intend to analyze.

### Simple Profiling

Enable profiling on any action:

```ruby
class UserCreation
  include Axn

  # Always profile this action
  profile

  expects :user_params

  def call
    user = User.create!(user_params)
    send_welcome_email(user)
  end

  private

  def send_welcome_email(user)
    UserMailer.welcome(user).deliver_now
  end
end
```

### Conditional Profiling

Profile only under specific conditions:

```ruby
class DataProcessing
  include Axn

  # Profile only when processing large datasets (only one profile call per action)
  profile if: -> { record_count > 1000 }

  expects :records, :record_count

  def call
    records.each { |record| process_record(record) }
  end
end
```

**Alternative using a method:**

```ruby
class DataProcessing
  include Axn

  # Profile using a method (only one profile call per action)
  profile if: :should_profile?

  expects :records, :record_count, :debug_mode, type: :boolean, default: false

  def should_profile?
    record_count > 1000 || debug_mode
  end

  def call
    records.each { |record| process_record(record) }
  end
end
```


## Advanced Usage

### Sampling Rate Control

Adjust the sampling rate per action:

```ruby
class DevelopmentAction
  include Axn

  # High sampling rate for development (more detailed data)
  profile(sample_rate: 0.5) if Rails.env.development?

  def call
    # Action logic
  end
end

class ProductionAction
  include Axn

  # Low sampling rate for production (minimal overhead)
  profile(sample_rate: 0.01) if Rails.env.production?

  def call
    # Action logic
  end
end
```

### Custom Output Directory

Organize profiles by environment or feature:

```ruby
class MyAction
  include Axn

  # Custom output directory
  profile(output_dir: Rails.root.join("tmp", "profiles", Rails.env))

  def call
    # Action logic
  end
end
```

### Multiple Conditions

Combine multiple profiling conditions:

```ruby
class ComplexAction
  include Axn

  # Profile when debug mode is enabled OR when processing admin users
  profile if: -> { debug_mode || user.admin? }

  expects :user, :debug_mode, type: :boolean, default: false

  def call
    # Complex logic
  end
end
```

## Viewing and Analyzing Profiles

### 1. Generate Profile Data

Run your action with profiling enabled:

```ruby
# This will generate a profile file if conditions are met
result = UserCreation.call(user_params: { name: "John", email: "john@example.com" })
```

### 2. Locate Profile Files

Profile files are saved as JSON in your configured output directory:

```bash
# Default location
ls tmp/profiles/

# Example output
axn_UserCreation_1703123456.json
axn_DataProcessing_1703123457.json
```

### 3. View in Firefox Profiler

1. Open [profiler.firefox.com](https://profiler.firefox.com/)
2. Click "Load a profile from file"
3. Select your generated JSON file
4. Analyze the performance data

### 4. Understanding the Profile

The Firefox Profiler provides several views:

- **Call Tree**: Shows the complete call stack with timing
- **Flame Graph**: Visual representation of call stacks
- **Stack Chart**: Timeline view of function calls
- **Markers**: Custom markers and events

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Conditional Profiling

Avoid profiling all actions in production:

```ruby
# Good: Conditional profiling
profile if: -> { Rails.env.development? || debug_mode }

# Avoid: Always profiling in production
profile  # This can impact performance
```

### 2. Appropriate Sampling Rates

Choose sampling rates based on your environment:

```ruby
class MyAction
  include Axn

  # High detail for debugging
  profile(sample_rate: 0.5) if Rails.env.development?

  # Moderate sampling for staging
  profile(sample_rate: 0.1) if Rails.env.staging?

  # Minimal overhead for production
  profile(sample_rate: 0.01) if Rails.env.production?

  def call
    # Action logic
  end
end
```

### 3. Profile Specific Scenarios

Focus on performance-critical paths:

```ruby
class OrderProcessing
  include Axn

  # Profile only expensive operations
  profile if: -> { order.total > 1000 }

  expects :order

  def call
    process_payment
    send_confirmation
    update_inventory
  end
end
```

### 4. Clean Up Old Profiles

Implement profile cleanup to avoid disk space issues:

```ruby
# Add to a rake task or cron job
namespace :profiles do
  desc "Clean up old profile files"
  task cleanup: :environment do
    profile_dir = Rails.root.join("tmp", "profiles")
    Dir.glob(File.join(profile_dir, "*.json")).each do |file|
      File.delete(file) if File.mtime(file) < 7.days.ago
    end
  end
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Vernier Not Available

If you see this error:

```
LoadError: Vernier gem is not loaded. Add `gem 'vernier', '~> 0.1'` to your Gemfile to enable profiling.
```

Make sure to:
1. Add `vernier` to your Gemfile
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Restart your application

### No Profile Files Generated

If profile files aren't being generated:

1. Verify your action has `profile` enabled
2. Ensure profiling conditions are met
3. Check the output directory exists and is writable

### Performance Impact

Profiling adds overhead to your application:

- **Sampling overhead**: ~1-5% depending on sample rate
- **File I/O**: Profile files are written to disk
- **Memory usage**: Slight increase due to sampling

Use appropriate sampling rates and conditional profiling to minimize impact.

## Integration with Other Tools

### Datadog Integration

Combine profiling with Datadog tracing:

```ruby
Axn.configure do |c|
  # Datadog tracing
  c.wrap_with_trace = proc do |resource, &action|
    Datadog::Tracing.trace("Action", resource:) do
      action.call
    end
  end
end

class MyAction
  include Axn

  # Profiling with custom options
  profile(sample_rate: 0.1)

  def call
    # Action logic
  end
end
```
